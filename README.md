# Best Day of the Year

Coding Bootcamp collaborative group project to solve a real world problem.

## Description

Our project permits a user to input their birthday using a datepicker and using server-side APIs and the application will return:

1. A summary of the weather on their birthday for every year they have lived
2. A summary of significant events that have occurred on their birthday
