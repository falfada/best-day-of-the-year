# Best Day of the Year

Coding Bootcamp collaborative group project to solve a real world problem.

## Description

Our project permits a user to input their birthday using a datepicker and using server-side APIs and the application will return:

1. A summary of the weather on their birthday for every year they have lived
2. A summary of significant events that have occurred on their birthday

## User story

```md
As a user who likes birthdays
I want to know what happened on my birthday
So I can prove it is the best day of the year
```

## Acceptance criteria

```md
GIVEN a form with a datepicker and location input
WHEN I input my birthdate and birthplace
THEN I am shown a weather summary for that location for every year of my life
WHEN I view the summary of a particular year
THEN I am shown a summary of any significant events that happened on my birthday 
```
